# 1. Create a method that takes a string as an argument and adds the phrase "Only in America!" to the end of it


# 2. Create a method to find the maximum value in an array of numbers. For instance: [100,10,-1000] should return 100. Do not use Ruby's built-in .max method.



# 3. Create a method that takes two arrays as arguments. You can assume both arrays are the same length. The first array will have symbols, the second will have strings. Use a loop to combine each symbol and string and add them to a hash. Return the hash.
    # Input:
    # [:toyota, :tesla]
    # ["Prius", "Model S"]

    # Expected output:
    # {toyota: "Prius", tesla: "Model S"}



# 4. Write a method that prints numbers from 1 to 100, except:
# for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number
# for multiples of five print "Buzz"
# Print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5.
